    [:p  "Twitter, Google, and Github all return JSON user-objects that are shaped differently, which meant we had to effectively search these objects and find the pieces of data we needed to feed back to Firebase, and all of them don't necessarily return the same information. "]
    [:p  "Another difficulty was the immense size of Firebase functionality, as they offer services for iOS, Web, Android, Node, etc, and each of these are complex tools, and the depth of the documentation keeps in kind with the tools. "]

    [:p  "That being said, there's absolutely nothing like the reward of pulling off a task, and serving up a feature right in the nick of time, that you've been working on for two weeks. So, nonetheless, I signed up for access to Twitter's API as a dev, and was able to implement that 3rd party feature, along with implementing Google sign in."]

It can be frustrating to build something up, just to have to tear it down, again and again, but you get a little better at building each time, and eventually that process pays major dividends."]]])
